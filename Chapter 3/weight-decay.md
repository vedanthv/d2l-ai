## Weight Decay

Now that we have characterized the problem of overfitting, we can introduce our first regularization technique. Recall that we can always mitigate overfitting by collecting more training data. 

However, that can be costly, time consuming, or entirely out of our control, making it impossible in the short run. For now, we can assume that we already have as much high-quality data as our resources permit and focus the tools at our disposal even when the dataset is taken as a given.

**It operates by restricting the values that a parameter can take**

We can measure the complexity of functions by the distance of its parameters from 0 if we initialize the values of the function f by 0.
